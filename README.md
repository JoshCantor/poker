I've created a poker game that deals to n number of players and evaluates the hand of each player. It's accessable via command line, and I'd love to create an interactive, in-browser implementation of the game.

Who: anyone who wants to play poker

Outputs: cards in a player's hand

Inputs: number of players

Tech: html, css, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, perhaps some libraries that I have yet to discover

Feature list: -->Visible features Card table, "avatar" for each player, individual cards

-->Interaction Buttons: start game/deal, discard/draw card, fold, show hand Other interactions: compare player hands, determine winner
